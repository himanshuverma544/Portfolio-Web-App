        I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. The point is that when I see a sunset or a <a href="#">waterfall</a> or something, for a split second it&apos;s so great, because for a little bit I&apos;m out of my brain, and it&apos;s got nothing to do with me. I&apos;m not trying to figure it out, you know what I mean? And I wonder if I can somehow find a way to maintain that mind stillness.
